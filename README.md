# kanjiquizbot
Kanji Quiz Bot for Discord written in Go

Quiz data is stored in .json files inside the quizzes folder. The format used is:
```
{
	"description": "A test deck",
	"deck": [
		{ "question": "未来",	"answers": [ "みらい" ] },
		{ "question": "On-yomi for 回",	"answers": [ "え", "かい" ] }
	]
}
```

Use this URL to invite your bot to a server:  
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=BOT_CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE  
after creating an app with the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

Uses the [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) project for API bindings and whatnot, and [Golang Freetype](https://github.com/golang/freetype) to draw fonts on an image.
